This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various commodities in India. The project entailed the scraping of data from the Indian government's official website for all Indian commodities. The scraping process involved the use of the Selenium library for automation and Beautiful Soup for monthly data scraping. The data from February, March, and April of 2020 was combined to create an extensive dataset for analysis.

## Analysis

The merged dataset was analyzed using Python, leveraging Pandas for data manipulation, analysis, and computation of key metrics. Additionally, the Seaborn library facilitated the creation of compelling visualizations to better understand the trends and patterns within the Indian commodities dataset. The analysis revealed valuable insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted various commodities in India during the early months of 2020.
